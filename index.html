						<h2>Welcome to me...</h2>
							<p>Creating things. It's what I love to do. Taking my ideas from paper and pen (and sometimes crayon) and making them
							come to life. Either through canvas and paint or in a computer program in the form of a brochure, logo, ad, or just a
							cartoon. I started creating with paint when I was 7 years old. That first brush stroke in a basement on the beach has lead me here to graphic and web design. I am a bit new to web design and programming, and you will find I am a quick study. Within these pages you will find me. My style and, hopefully, my voice. Please to enjoy.</p>

						<h2>What I Create...</h2>
							<p>Banners, brochures, logos, business cards, and anything else you might find yourself in need of having designed. I like a challenge and I love to approach designs at every angle possible. Outside of the box or inside of the box. What ever may fit your needs. I enjoying taking ideas and turning them into a functional, creative, design.</p>
							<p>Photo editing may not be creating in the traditional sense, but I do have a good deal of experience in this medium. Photo retouching, editing, and photo reconstruction. I have also dealt in chroma key images to create themed group photos.</p>
							<p>Painting is a long passion of mine. I first starting painting at the age of 7 and it stuck with me every sense. I paint in several mediums: Oil on canvas, acrylic on canvas or anything I might have laying around, crayon, color pencil, and mix media on found objects. </p>

						<h2>Experience I would like...</h2>
							<p>I have recently started exploring HTML and CSS coding for websites. I have long considered myself a traditional print only designer and I have felt it has always hindered my creative outlets and resources. I want to learn more in this subject by way of employment and experience. Challenging and constant changing is right up my alley. Creating beautiful and functional websites for a client is even better.</p>
							<p>Along with learning HTML and CSS, I have also been dipping my toe into the JavaScript language. Ever since being introduced to this coding language in a class offered at a local tech hub, I have been fascinated with JavaScript. I have been wanting to find employment that will allow me to work more closely with this language. To be in an environment that will cultivate my knowledge and curiosity of these languages.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-4">
						<h2>My hobbies...</h2>
							<p>When I am not behind a computer monitor, I enjoy painting, sketching, playing various video games (which puts me right back behind a monitor), and studying the rules of Flat Track Roller Derby. At one time, I was a referee in this home grown, blue grass sport. I have since retired, but I still can't help but read the rules and stream the games online from the Derby News Network. Once you experience strong, athletic girls slamming into each other and playing offense and defense simultaneously, you can't help but be hooked.</p>
							<p>Another hobby is sculpting and pottery. I found this medium while in college. I try to find places in town that hold pottery classes on the weekends and allow access to wheels and kilns. I don't get to indulge in this hobby as much as I like, but, when the opportunity presents itself, I jump on it. </p>
